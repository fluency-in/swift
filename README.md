# Swift Exercises

Each subdirectory in this repository is an exercise.

Each exercise consists of a README.md and some automated tests.

In order to use Swift, you must be running Xcode version 7.3 or greater which is available at [Apple's developer center][appledev].

[appledev]: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/

The exercises use XCTest.

See [this guide][exercism-xcode-swift] for details about how to create the project in XCode and run the tests.
